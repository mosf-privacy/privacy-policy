  <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
  <p><small>Last updated: 2025‑12‑26</small></p>

  <p>Mosf - Tasks App (“we”, “our”, “us”) respects your privacy. This policy explains what data we process and why.</p>

  <h2>Data We Process</h2>
  <p>
    • App data (categories, tasks, subtasks, “Marked” flags) is stored locally on your device using Apple’s Core Data.<br>
    • iCloud Sync (CloudKit): If you are signed in to iCloud, your app data is synchronized securely via Apple iCloud using CloudKit. The data is associated with your Apple ID and synced across your devices signed in with the same Apple ID. Apple provides iCloud as an independent service provider. Learn more at
    <a href="https://www.apple.com/legal/privacy/en-ww/">Apple’s Privacy Policy</a>.
  </p>

  <h2>Purpose and Legal Basis</h2>
  <p>We process data to provide the app’s core functionality. iCloud sync is offered to deliver seamless multi‑device use at your request.</p>

  <h2>Analytics and Crash Reports</h2>
  <p>We do not use third‑party analytics or tracking SDKs. Apple may collect anonymized diagnostics and crash reports if you have opted in at the system level. These reports are controlled by Apple and your device settings.</p>

  <h2>Sharing and Disclosure</h2>
  <p>We do not sell personal data. We do not share your app data with third parties except as necessary to provide iCloud synchronization (Apple) or as required by law.</p>

  <h2>Data Retention and Deletion</h2>
  <p>
    • Local data remains on your device. You can delete items within the app or remove the app to delete local data.<br>
    • iCloud data can be managed or deleted via iOS Settings → [your name] → iCloud → Manage Account Storage, or at iCloud.com.
  </p>

  <h2>Your Rights</h2>
  <p>Depending on your jurisdiction, you may have rights to access, correct, delete, restrict, or object to processing, and data portability. You may also have the right to lodge a complaint with your supervisory authority.</p>

  <h2>Contact</h2>
  <p>
    For privacy inquiries, contact the data controller at:

  <h2>Changes to This Policy</h2>
